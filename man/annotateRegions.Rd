\title{Assign genomic states to regions}
\usage{
annotateRegions(regions, genomicState, minoverlap = 20,
  fullOrCoding = "full", annotate = TRUE, chrsStyle = "UCSC",
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{The \code{$regions} output from \link{calculatePvalues}.}

\item{genomicState}{The output from \link{makeGenomicState}.}

\item{minoverlap}{This parameter is passed to \link[IRanges]{countOverlaps}
and determines the minimum overlap of a region to be assined a genomic
state. Set to 1 if you want all the genomic states that overlap the regions.}

\item{fullOrCoding}{If \code{full} then the \code{genomicState$fullGenome}
genomic state information is used. If \code{coding}, then the
\code{genomicState$codingGenome} genomic state information is used.}

\item{annotate}{If \code{TRUE} then the regions are annotated by the genomic
state. Othewise, only the overlaps between the regions and the genomic
states are computed.}

\item{chrsStyle}{The naming style of the chromosomes. By default, UCSC. See
\link[GenomeInfoDb]{seqlevelsStyle}.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} basic status updates will be printed along the
way.}
}
\value{
A list with elements \code{countTable} and \code{annotationList}
(only if \code{annotate=TRUE}).
\describe{
\item{countTable }{This is a data.frame with the number of overlaps from the
regions vs the genomic states with one type per column. For example, if
\code{fullOrCoding='full'} then the columns are \code{exon},
\code{intragenic} and \code{intron}.}
\item{annotationList }{This is a \code{GRangesList} with the genomic states
that overlapped with the regions (if any, depends on \code{minoverlap}). The
names of this \code{GRangesList} correspond to the region index in
\code{regions}.}
}
}
\description{
This function takes the regions found in \link{calculatePvalues} and assigns
them genomic states contructed with \link{makeGenomicState}. The main
workhorse functions are \link[IRanges]{countOverlaps} and
\link[IRanges]{findOverlaps}.
