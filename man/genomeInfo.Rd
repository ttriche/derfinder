\title{Genome samples information}
\format{A data.frame with 5 columns:
\describe{
\item{run }{ The short name used to identify the sample BAM file.}
\item{library.layout }{ Whether it was a single-end library or a paired-end
library.}
\item{hapmap.id }{ The HapMap identifier of the person sequenced. Note that
some were sequenced more than once.}
\item{gender }{ Whether the person sequence is a female or a male.}
\item{pop }{ The population the person belongs to.}
}}
\description{
Information for the 31 samples downloaded from the Short Read Archive from
studies comparing CEU and YRI populations. This data is used to specify the
adjustment variables in \link{calculateStats}. The data is sorted according
to the BAM files identifiers. Reads were 36bp long.
}
\details{
The samples are from:
\describe{
\item{10 }{ unrelated females from the YRI population.}
\item{5 }{ unrelated females from the CEU population.}
\item{5 }{ unrelated males (unrelated to the females too) from the CEU
population.}
}
