\title{Make clusters of genomic locations based on distance in Rle() world}
\usage{
clusterMakerRle(position, maxGap = 300L, ranges = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{position}{A logical Rle indicating the chromosome positions.}

\item{maxGap}{An integer. Genomic locations within \code{maxGap} from each
other are placed into the same cluster.}

\item{ranges}{If \code{TRUE} then an IRanges object is returned instead of
the usual integer Rle.}
}
\value{
An integer Rle with the cluster IDs. If \code{ranges=TRUE} then it
is an IRanges object with one range per cluster.
}
\description{
Genomic locations are grouped into clusters based on distance: locations
that are close to each other are assigned to the same cluster. The operation
is performed on each chromosome independently. This is very similar to
\link[bumphunter]{clusterMaker}.
}
\details{
\link[bumphunter]{clusterMaker} adapted to Rle world. Assumes that the data
is sorted and that everything is in a single chromosome.
It is also almost as fast as the original version with the advantage that
everything is in Rle() world.

It is a a helper function for \link{findRegions}.

\examples{
library('IRanges')
set.seed(20130725)
pos <- Rle(sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 1e5, TRUE, prob=c(0.05, 0.95)))
cluster <- clusterMakerRle(pos, 100L)
cluster

\dontrun{
## clusterMakerRle() is comparable in speed if you start from the Rle world.
library('bumphunter')
library('microbenchmark')
micro <- microbenchmark(clusterMakerRle(pos, 100L),
    clusterMaker(chr=rep('chr21', sum(pos)), pos=which(pos)))
micro
