CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.64
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o fullCoverage() has several new arguments and now is a full parallel 
        implementation of loadCoverage(). These changes were introduced since
        fullCoverage() no longer blows up in memory since version 0.0.62 and
        thus the new recommended use case is to call fullCoverage() instead of
        running one job with loadCoverage() per chromosome or using a lapply()
        loop.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.63
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o fstats.apply() now has 'method' and 'scalefac' arguments. The 'method'
        argument controls which of the 3 implementations to use. The old method
        is called 'regular' now. The new method 'Rle' calculates the 
        F-statistics without de-compressing the data, which is good for memory
        but gets considerably slower as the number of samples increases. The
        default method is 'Matrix' which uses the Matrix package and is both 
        faster (given that the coercion doesn't take long) and less memory
        intensive than the 'regular' method.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Functions analyzeChr(), calculatePvalues() and calculateStats() now have
        arguments 'method' and 'scalefac' to match the changes in fstats.apply()

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.62
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o derfinder now uses BiocParallel::blapply() instead of parallel::mclapply()
        When 'mc.cores' is greater than 1, BiocParallel::SnowParam() is used to
        construct the cluster. Otherwise, BiocParallel::SerialParam() is used.
        This change reduces memory load when using the functions that have the
        'mc.cores' argument greater than 1.

    o Functions analyzeChr(), calculatePvalues(), calculateStats(),
        coverageToExon(), fullCoverage(), getRegionCoverage(), regionMatrix()
        all have a new argument 'mc.output'. This is passed to 
        BiocParallel::SnowParam(outfile).

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o You may now use fullCoverage() without problems and should no longer
        encounter errors due to longer vectors not being implemented.
    o Functions like fullCoverage() now use much less memory and do not blow up
        as you increase 'mc.cores'. Note however that the memory does increase,
        but now it's close to linear.
    o Examples might take longer to run with 'mc.cores' greater than 1, but that
        is due to the small setup overhead of BiocParallel::SnowParam() which
        is minimal compared to the overall speed gains with real data sets.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.61
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o filterData() and loadCoverage() now have arguments 'totalMapped' and 
        'targetSize'
    o getRegionCoverage() and regionMatrix() can now work with list output from 
        loadCoverage() with a non-NULL cutoff
    o regionMatrix() now has an argument 'runFilter' so it can be used with 
        previous output from loadCoverage()/filterData() with 'returnMean=TRUE'

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.60
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o analyzeChr(), annotateRegions(), calculatePvalues(), coverageToExon(),
        findRegions(), fullCoverage(), getRegionCoverage(), 
        makeGenomicState(), mergeResults(), plotCluster(), plotOverview()
        now all have 'chrsStyle' as an argument to specify the chromosome 
        naming convention used. Defaults to UCSC.
    o makeGenomicState() no longer has the 'addChrPrefix' argument. It has been
        replaced by 'chrsStyle' to use GenomeInfoDb to set the naming style.
    o 'chrnums' has been renamed to 'chrs' in fullCoverage() and mergeResults()
    o 'chrnum' has been renamed to 'chr' in analyzeChr()

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.59

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.57
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o regionMatrix() now relies on getRegionCoverage() instead of 
        coverageToExon() making it faster and less memory intensive.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.56
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added regionMatrix() for filtering coverage data and using the resulting
        regions to construct a count matrix. Uses several derfinder functions.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Made coverageToExon() more robust for different names in 'fullCov'.
    o filterData() and loadCoverage() have new arguments 'filter', 'returnMean',
        and 'returnCoverage' which allow speeding up regionMatrix(). 
        preprocessCoverage() was changed accordingly.
    o getRegionCoverage() now internally uses USCS names.

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed warnings in coverageToExon().


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.55
